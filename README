cake-maker is a program for producing a set of 'cake' maps for 
an open streetmap mapping party.

To use cake-maker you need


1) Mapnik installed
2) Cacadnik installed
3) A postgis database from osm2pgsql that contains the OSM data you
   wish to include on your diagrams.
4) A .osm file that contains the 'cake' segments for your mapping party.
   See example_cake.osm.


Instructions
------------------


Step 1
---------

Using JOSM (or another OSM editor) create a .osm file containing closed
area ways that make up your 'cake' segments.  Each cake
should be tagged as 'landuse=cake'.  Next inside each of the areas
you can create a single node that will have a 'name' key that will 
be a label for the cake segment.

Step 2
---------
Edit cascadenik-stype/style.mml.

Set  host,port,user,password,dbname to point at your postgis databsae.

Set 'file' in the layer 'cake area' to point at your cake file.


Step 3
------------
Run cascadnik-compile on style.mml to generate osm.xml


Step 4
---------
Run 'cake-maker.py cakesegments.osm' to generate the cake files.

This should generate a set of PNG and SVG files containing the maps
